\section{The computation of $G_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$}
\subsection{The computation of the first block $M_{11}$}
\begin{proposition}
\label{prop.centralizer.dimension}
Let $x=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\lambda_i e_{i,i+1}$, where $\lambda_i\in\mathbb{Q}_p$ are not all zero. Then $\dim\sfrac{\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)}{\gamma_2}=\mathfrak{l}(x)+\mathfrak{m}(x)$, where $\mathfrak{l}(x)$ is the number of sequences of consecutive non-zero coefficients of the form $\lambda_j,\lambda_{j+1},\dots,\lambda_{j+k-1},\lambda_{j+k}$ and $\lambda_{j-1}=\lambda_{j+k+1}=0$ (that is, the sequences are separated by one of more zero coefficients)\footnote{We extend our notation of indices, to include also the case where $j=1$ or $j+k=n-1$, and define that $\lambda_{j-1}=\lambda_0=0$ or $\lambda_{j+k+1}=\lambda_n=0$, respectively}, and $\mathfrak{m}(x)$ is the number of zero coefficients $\lambda_j=0$, such that also $\lambda_{j-1}=\lambda_{j+1}=0$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $y=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\mu_i e_{i,i+1}$, where $\lambda_i\in\mathbb{Q}_p$, be an element in the quotient $\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}$.
For every $1\leq i\leq n-1$, denote by $(\mathfrak{C}_i)$ the constraint equation $[\lambda_i e_{i,i+1},\mu_{i+1}e_{i+1,i+2}]-[\lambda_{i+1}e_{i+1,i+2},\mu_i e_{i,i+1}]=(\lambda_i\mu_{i+1}-\lambda_{i+1}\mu_i)e_{i,i+2}=0$, and it is clear that $y\in\sfrac{\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)}{\gamma_2}$ if and only if all the $(\mathfrak{C}_i)$ constraints are satisfied. We observe that each $\mu_i$ participates in two constraints, $(\mathfrak{C}_{i-1})$ and $(\mathfrak{C}_i)$, that is, $\lambda_{i-1}\mu_i-\lambda_i\mu_{i-1}=\lambda_i\mu_{i+1}-\lambda_{i+1}\mu_i=0$. If $\lambda_i=0$, then $\lambda_i\mu_{i-1}=\lambda_i\mu_{i+1}=0$, hence by constraint $(\mathfrak{C}_{i-1})$ we have that $\lambda_{i-1}\mu_i=0$, and by constraint $(\mathfrak{C}_i)$ we have that $\lambda_{i+1}\mu_i=0$. Hence, if either $\lambda_{i-1}$ or $\lambda_{i+1}$ are non-zero, then $\mu_i=0$. But if $\lambda_{i-1}=\lambda_{i+1}=0$, then both constraints are satisfied for any choice of $\mu_i$, which increases $\dim\sfrac{\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)}{\gamma_2}$ by $1$. We need to prove that for any sequence of $k$ consecutive zero coefficients of $x$, where $k\geq 3$, that is\footnote{Here again, we consider the non-existent $\lambda_0=\lambda_n=0$ as part of the sequence} $\lambda_{j+1}=\lambda_{j+2}=\cdots=\lambda_{j+k}=0$, for $1\leq j\leq n-2$, we have that the sequence $\mu_{j+2},\mu_{j+3},\dots,\mu_{j+k-1}$ of $k-2$ consecutive coefficients of $y$ is made of scalars of any choice, thus $\dim\sfrac{\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)}{\gamma_2}$ is increased by $k-2$. We prove that by simple induction on $k$. For $k=3$, we just proved that if $\lambda_{i-1}=\lambda_i=\lambda_{i+1}=0$, then $\mu_i$ can be any scalar. For $k+1$, we look at the sequence of $k+1$ zero coefficients, $\lambda_{j+1}=\lambda_{j+2}=\cdots=\lambda_{j+k}=\lambda_{j+k+1}=0$. By constraints $(\mathfrak{C}_{j+k-1})$ and $(\mathfrak{C}_{j+k})$, we have that $\lambda_{j+k-1}\mu_{j+k}-\lambda_{j+k}\mu_{j+k-1}=\lambda_{j+k}\mu_{j+k+1}-\lambda_{j+k+1}\mu_{j+k}=0$, and since $\lambda_{j+k-1}=\lambda_{j+k}=\lambda_{j+k+1}=0$, we have that $\mu_{j+k}$ can be any scalar, as we proved earlier. By the assumption, we have that all $k-2$ previous coefficients, that is $\mu_{j+2},\dots,\mu_{j+k-1}$ can also be any scalars, so in total the whole sequence of $k-1=(k+1)-2$ coefficients of $y$ can be any scalars, which proves the induction step. Suppose that we have $m$ sequences of three or more consecutive zero coefficients in $x$, whose lengths are $k_1,k_2,\dots,k_m$, then $\mathfrak{m}(x)=\sum_{l=1}^m k_l-2m$ is the total number of zero coefficients $\lambda_j=0$ such that also $\lambda_{j-1}=\lambda_{j+1}=0$, as proposed. Using again the two consecutive constraints, $(\mathfrak{C}_{i-1})$ and $(\mathfrak{C}_i)$,
suppose now that $\lambda_i\neq 0$. If $\lambda_{i-1}=0$, then by constraint $(\mathfrak{C}_{i-1})$ we must have that $\mu_{i-1}=0$, but if $\lambda_{i-1}\neq 0$, then by this constraint we have $\mu_i=\frac{\lambda_i\mu_{i-1}}{\lambda_{i-1}}$, which means that $\mu_i$ depends on $\mu_{i-1}$. Precisely the same way for constraint $(\mathfrak{C}_i)$, we have that if $\lambda_{i+1}=0$ then $\mu_{i+1}=0$, otherwise $\mu_{i+1}=\frac{\lambda_{i+1}\mu_i}{\lambda_i}$, which means that $\mu_{i+1}$ depends on $\mu_i$, and if also $\lambda_{i-1}\neq 0$, then $\mu_{i+1}=\frac{\lambda_{i+1}\frac{\lambda_i\mu_{i-1}}{\lambda_{i-1}}}{\lambda_i}=\frac{\lambda_{i+1}\mu_{i-1}}{\lambda_{i-1}}$, which means that both $\mu_{i+1}$ and $\mu_i$ depend on $\mu_{i-1}$. We need to prove this is true for any sequence of $k$ consecutive non-zero coefficients of $x$, that is, for a given sequence of coefficients, $\lambda_{j+1},\lambda_{j+2},\dots,\lambda_{j+k}$, where $1\leq j\leq n-1$, we need to prove that $\mu_{j+1}$ can be any scalar, while $\mu_{j+2},\mu_{j+3},\dots,\mu_{j+k}$ all depend on $\mu_{j+1}$. Here again, we use a simple induction on $k$. For $k=1,2,3$, we already proved this. For $k+1$, we look into a sequence of $k+1$ consecutive non-zero coefficients of $x$, that is $\lambda_{j+1},\dots,\lambda_{j+k},\lambda_{j+k+1}$. By constraint $(\mathfrak{C}_{j+k})$ we have $\lambda_{j+k}\mu_{j+k+1}-\lambda_{j+k+1}\mu_{j+k}=0$, and since $\lambda_{j+k}\neq 0$, we have $\mu_{j+k+1}=\frac{\lambda_{j+k+1}\mu_{j+k}}{\lambda_{j+k}}$, but by the assumption, $\mu_{j+k}=\frac{\lambda_{j+k}\mu_{j+k-1}}{\lambda_{j+k-1}}=\frac{\lambda_{j+k}}{\lambda_{j+k-1}}\frac{\lambda_{j+k-1}\mu_{j+k-2}}{\lambda_{j+k-2}}=\frac{\lambda_{j+k}}{\lambda_{j+k-1}}\frac{\lambda_{j+k-1}}{\lambda_{j+k-2}}\frac{\lambda_{j+k-2}\mu_{j+k-3}}{\lambda_{j+k-3}}=\cdots=\frac{\lambda_{j+k}\mu_{j+1}}{\lambda_{j+1}}$, hence $\mu_{j+k+1}=\frac{\lambda_{j+k+1}\mu_{j+k}}{\lambda_{j+k}}=\frac{\lambda_{j+k+1}}{\lambda_{j+k}}\frac{\lambda_{j+k}\mu_{j+1}}{\lambda_{j+1}}=\frac{\lambda_{j+k+1}\mu_{j+1}}{\lambda_{j+1}}$, which proves the induction step. Looking again at $(\mathfrak{C}_{i-1})$ and $(\mathfrak{C}_i)$, we observe that if $\lambda_{i-1}$ and $\lambda_{i+1}$ are non-zero and $\lambda_i=0$, then $\lambda_i\mu_{i-1}=\lambda_i\mu_{i+1}=0$, hence by constraint $(\mathfrak{C}_{i-1})$ we have that $\lambda_{i-1}\mu_i=0$, and by constraint $(\mathfrak{C}_i)$ we have that $\lambda_{i+1}\mu_i=0$, so $\mu_i=0$ by both constraints, which means that there is no dependency between $\mu_{i+1}$ and $\mu_{i-1}$. This shows that any zero coefficient between two non-zero coefficients of $x$ creates two separate sequences, each sequences increases $\dim\sfrac{\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)}{\gamma_2}$ by $1$, hence, if we have $l$ sequences of consecutive non-zero coefficients of $x$, they increase $\dim\sfrac{\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)}{\gamma_2}$ by $l$, and we denote $\mathfrak{l}(x)=l$. All this shows that $\dim\sfrac{\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)}{\gamma_2}=\mathfrak{l}(x)+\mathfrak{m}(x)$, as proposed.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
\label{prop.n.geq.4.centralizer.codimension}
Let $\mathcal{L}_{n,p}$ be the $\mathbb{Q}_p$-Lie algebra associated with $\mathcal{U}_n(\mathbb{Z})$. If $n\geq 5$, then $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)=\dim\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}-1$ if and only if $x\in\{\lambda e_{12}+\gamma_2\mathcal{L}_{n,p}\}$ or $x\in\{\lambda e_{n-1,n}+\gamma_2\mathcal{L}_{n,p}\}$, for a non-zero scalar $\lambda\in\mathbb{Q}_p$. If $n=4$, then $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)=\dim\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}-1$ if and only if $x\in\{\lambda e_{12}+\mu e_{34}+\gamma_2\mathcal{L}_{n,p}\}$, for $\lambda,\mu\in\mathbb{Q}_p$ not both zero.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
We recall first that for any algebra $\mathcal{L}_{n,p}$, the first two elements of the lower central series, namely $\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}$ and $\sfrac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_3}$, are of sizes $n-1$ and $n-2$, respectively. Consider the Lie brackets operation $[x_1,x_2]$, where $x_1\in\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}$ and $x_2\in\sfrac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_3}$, or the opposite, then $[x_1,x_2]$ can be either zero, or $[x_1,x_2]\in\gamma_3$, which means that if we consider the centralizer of some $x\in\mathcal{L}_{n,p}$ in $\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}$, then any element $y\in\sfrac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_3}$ would either commute with $x$ or yield an element in $\gamma_3$, which also means that it commutes with $x$ in $\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}$. This shows that $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)\geq\dim\sfrac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_3}=n-2$. Suppose that $x=\lambda_1 e_{12}+z$ or $x=\lambda_{n-1}e_{n-1,n}+z$, where $z\in\gamma_2\mathcal{L}_{n,p}$, then looking only at the elements of $\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}$ in the linear combination that forms $x$, we have one sequence of one non-zero coefficient, hence $\mathfrak{l}(x)=1$, and one sequence of $n-1-1=n-2$ zero coefficients of $x$, hence we have\footnote{Again, we consider also $\lambda_0=0$ and $\lambda_n=0$, hence the sequence of zero coefficients is either $\lambda_2=\lambda_3=\cdots=\lambda_{n-2}=\lambda_{n-1}=\lambda_n=0$ if $\lambda_1\neq 0$, or $\lambda_0=\lambda_1=\lambda_2=\cdots=\lambda_{n-3}=\lambda_{n-2}=0$, if $\lambda_{n-1}\neq 0$, which means that the length of the entire sequence of zero coefficients is not $n-2$ but $n-1$, therefore by \ref{prop.centralizer.dimension} we have that $\mathfrak{m}(x)=n-1-2=n-3$} that $\mathfrak{m}(x)=n-2-1=n-3$. By \ref{prop.centralizer.dimension} we have that $\dim\sfrac{\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)}{\gamma_2}=\mathfrak{l}(x)+\mathfrak{m}(x)=1+(n-3)=n-2$. Adding all the elements of $\sfrac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_3}$, we have that $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)=(n-2)+(n-2)=2n-4=(n-1)+(n-2)-1=\dim\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}+\dim\sfrac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_3}-1=\dim\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}-1$, as proposed. To prove the opposite direction, we assume that $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)=\dim\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}-1=2n-4$, and since we already know that all the elements of $\dim\sfrac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_3}$ are in the centralizer of $x$, we have that $\dim\sfrac{\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)}{\gamma_2}=\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)-\dim\sfrac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_3}=(2n-4)-(n-2)=n-2=(n-1)-1=\dim\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}-1$. Suppose that either $x=\lambda_i e_{i,i+1}+z$ where $1<i<n-1$, or $x=\lambda_{i_1}e_{i_1,i_1+1}+\cdots+\lambda_{i_m}e_{i_m,i_m+1}$ where we denote the number of $\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}$ coefficients\footnote{In words, $x$ has at least two non-zero coefficients in $\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}$} by $2\leq m\leq n-1$, in both cases $z\in\gamma_2\mathcal{L}_{n,p}$. In the first case, we have that $\mathfrak{l}(x)=1$, because there is only one non-zero coefficient of $x$ in $\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}$, and we have two sequences of zero coefficients of $x$, that is $\lambda_0=\lambda_1=\lambda_2=\cdots=\lambda_{i-2}=\lambda_{i-1}=0$ and $\lambda_{i+1}=\lambda_{i+2}=\lambda_{i+3}=\cdots=\lambda_{n-2}=\lambda_{n-1}=\lambda_n=0$, which means we have a sequence of zeros of length $(i-1)+1=i$ and a sequence of length $(n-1)-i+1=n-i$, hence by \ref{prop.centralizer.dimension} $\mathfrak{}$ we have\footnote{Here, and in all the following options, $\mathfrak{m}(x)$ has an upper bound which depend on the number of consecutive zero coefficients of $x$, because if any of these sequences is of length $k$, where $k<3$, then $\mathfrak{m}(x)=k-2\leq 0$} that $\mathfrak{m}(x)\leq(i-2)+(n-i-2)=n-4$, which means that $\dim\sfrac{\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)}{\gamma_2}=\mathfrak{l}(x)+\mathfrak{m}(x)\leq 1+(n-4)=n-3=(n-1)-2=\dim\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}-2$. Adding all the elements of $\sfrac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_3}$, we have that $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)=\dim\sfrac{\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)}{\gamma_2}+\dim\sfrac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_3}=(n-3)+(n-2)=2n-5<2n-4$, which contradicts the assumption. Suppose that $x$ is of the second form, then $x$ may have one sequence of $k$ non-zero coefficients, where $k>1$, or have two or more sequences of non-zero coefficients. In the case that $x$ has one sequence of $k$ non-zero coefficients, $\mathfrak{l}(x)=1$, and the number of consecutive zero coefficients is either less or equal\footnote{} to $(n-1)-k+1=n-k$, which results in $\mathfrak{m}(x)\leq n-k-2$, if the sequence of non-zero coefficients contains\footnote{That is, $x=\lambda_1 e_{12}+\lambda_2 e_{23}+\cdots+\lambda_{k,k+1}e_{k,k+1}$ or $x=\lambda_{n-k}e_{n-k,n-k+1}+\lambda_{n-k+1}e_{n-k+1,n-k+2}+\cdots+\lambda_{n-1}e_{n-1,n}$} either $\lambda_1$ or $\lambda_{n-1}$, or the number of consecutive zero coefficients is divided into two separate sequences with a total number of consecutive zeros which is less or equal to $(n-1)-k+2=n-k+1$, which results in $\mathfrak{m}(x)\leq n-k+1-4=n-k-3$, in the case that the sequence of non-zero coefficients of $x$ does not contains either $\lambda_1$ or $\lambda_{n-1}$, which means that $\mathfrak{l}(x)+\mathfrak{m}(x)\leq 1+(n-k-2)=n-k-1$, and since $k>1$, we have that $\dim\sfrac{\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)}{\gamma_2}=\mathfrak{l}(x)+\mathfrak{m}(x)\leq n-2-1=n-3=(n-1)-2$, which again contradicts the assumption. Suppose that $x$ has $l$ sequences of non-zero coefficients in $\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}$, of lengths $k_1,k_2,\dots,k_l$, then $\mathfrak{l}(x)=l$, and the number of zeros is $n-1-\sum_{j=1}^l k_j$. Considering the two options from earlier, whether any of the sequences of non-zero coefficients contains $\lambda_1$ or $\lambda_{n-1}$, or does not contain either of them, we observe that $\mathfrak{m}(x)\leq$

Looking into the elements of $\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}$ itself, then by \ref{prop.centralizer.dimension}, we have that $\dim\sfrac{\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)}{\gamma_2}=$




Let $z=\lambda_{j,j+2}e_{j,j+2}$, where $1\leq j\leq n-2$ and $\lambda_{j,j+2}\in\mathbb{Q}_p$, then for every $w\in\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}$, either $z$ commutes with $w$ or $[z,w]\in\gamma_3\mathcal{L}_{n,p}$, which means that $\lambda_{j,j+2}e_{j,j+2}\in\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}$, for every $1\leq j\leq n-2$. Hence, $\sfrac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_3}=\langle e_{13},e_{24},\dots,e_{n-2,n}\rangle\subset\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(x)$. Therefore, we only need to discuss elements of the quotient $\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}$, for the purpose of this proof.
Suppose that $x=\lambda_1 e_{12}+z$, where $z\in\gamma_2\mathcal{L}_{n,p}$, then we have one sequence of non-zero coefficients, namely $\lambda_1$, and we have $n-2$ zero coefficients $\lambda_2=\lambda_3=\cdots=\lambda_{n-1}=0$, from which $n-3$ are between two other zeros. Hence, by \ref{prop.centralizer.dimension}, we have that $\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(x)=1+(n-3)=n-2=(n-1)-1=\dim\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}-1$. Similarly, the same goes also for $x=\lambda_{n-1}e_{n-1,n}+z$.
Suppose that $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(x)=\dim\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}-1$, but $x=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\lambda_i e_{i,i+1}$, such that either of the following options is true:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item there is more than one sequence of consecutive non-zero coefficients in the linear combination that forms $x$.
  \item there is one sequence of consecutive non-zero coefficients, but at least one of those coefficients has index $2\leq j\leq n-2$, meaning it is not $\lambda_1$ nor $\lambda_{n-1}$.
\end{enumerate}
For the second option, we start by fixing one index $2\leq j\leq n-2$, and assume that $x=\lambda_j e_{j,j+1}$. The number of zero coefficients in $x$ is $n-1-1=n-2$, but $\lambda_j$ and the zeros in indices $j-1,j+1$ are neighboring, hence $m_1=n-2-2=n-4$, and then $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(x)=l_1+m_1=1+n-4=n-3<n-2=\dim\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}-1$.
We denote by $k$ the length of the sequence of consecutive non-zero parameters, and prove that for any $k>0$, where at least one non-zero coefficient $\lambda_j$ lies in $2\leq j\leq n-2$, $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(x)<n-2$, by simple induction on $k$. For $k=1$, we have just shown that. For $k>1$, there are $k-1$ additional zeros that are replaced by non-zero coefficients, where except for $\lambda_{j-1}$ and $\lambda_{j+1}$, all the other zeros were originally lying between two other zeros. If the original sequence was $\lambda_2 e_{23}$ or $\lambda_{n-2}e_{n-2,n-1}$, and the new sequence is $\lambda_1 e_{12},\lambda_2 e_{23}$ or $\lambda_{n-2}e_{n-2,n-1},\lambda_{n-1}e_{n-1,n}$, respectively, then $m_k=m_1$, but clearly, in any other case, $m_k<m_1$, while $l_k=l_1=1$ at any case. by the assumption, for the original sequence, $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(x)=l_1+m_1<n-2$, hence for the new sequence, $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(x)=l_k+m_k\leq l_1+m_1=n-3<n-2$. Now we check the first option, starting from the case where $x=\lambda_1 e_{12}+\lambda_{n-1}e_{n-1,n}$. In this case, $l_2=2$ and the number of zeros is $n-1-2=n-3$, but $\lambda_1$ and the zero in index $2$ are neighboring, and so are $\lambda_{n-1}$ and the zero in index $n-2$, hence $m_2=n-3-2=n-5$ zeros are lying between two other zeros, therefore $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(x)=l_2+m_2=n-5+2=n-3<n-2$. if we add another non-zero coefficient, then it must lie in some index $2\leq j\leq n-2$, for which we have already proved that $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(x)<n-2$, which completes the proof for $n\geq 5$. For $n=4$, we can check explicitly. Assume $x=\lambda e_{12}+\mu e_{34}$, denote an element in the centralizer of $x$ by $y=\rho e_{12}+\tau e_{23}+\nu e_{34}$, and we observe that $[x,y]=[\lambda e_{12},\tau e_{23}]+[\mu e_{34},\tau e_{23}]=\lambda\tau e_{13}-\tau\mu e_{24}=0$, hence $\tau=0$, while $\rho=*$ and $\nu=*$, so $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(x)=2=\dim\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}-1$, as requested, and it is readily seen that even if either $\lambda=0$ or $\mu=0$, but not both, then $\tau$ still has to be zero, in order to satisfy either $\tau\mu=0$ or $\lambda\tau=0$, respectively, and $\rho,\nu$ can still be anything, which means that in either case, where the coefficient of $e_{23}$ is zero but $x\neq 0$, we have $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(x)=2$. Assume $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(x)=\dim\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}-1=3-1=2$, then if $x$ is not of the suggested form, it means that $x=\lambda e_{12}+\sigma e_{23}+\mu e_{34}$, where $\sigma\neq 0$ and either $\lambda$ or $\mu$ or both can be zero.
If $x=\lambda e_{12}+\sigma e_{23}+\mu e_{34}$ and all coefficients are non-zero, then for every $y\in\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(x)$ denoted by $y=\rho e_{12}+\tau e_{23}+\nu e_{34}$, we have $[x,y]=[\lambda e_{12},\tau e_{23}]+[\sigma e_{23},\rho e_{12}]+[\sigma e_{23},\nu e_{34}]+[\mu e_{34},\tau e_{23}]=(\lambda\tau-\sigma\rho)e_{13}+(\sigma\nu-\mu\tau)e_{24}$, hence $\tau=\frac{\sigma}{\lambda}\rho$ and $\nu=\frac{\mu}{\sigma}\tau=\frac{\mu}{\sigma}\frac{\sigma}{\lambda}\rho=\frac{\mu}{\lambda}\rho$, but this means that $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(x)=1$, because both $\tau$ and $\nu$ depend on $\rho$. If either $\lambda$ or $\mu$ or both are zero, then either $\sigma\rho$ or $\sigma\mu$ or both are zero, which means that $\rho$ or $\nu$ or both are zero, since $\sigma\neq 0$, but this means that either $y=\tau e_{23}+\frac{\mu}{\sigma}\tau e_{34}$ or $y=\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}\tau e_{12}+\tau e_{23}$ or $y=\tau e_{23}$, respectively. Therefore, in either case, where $\sigma\neq 0$, we have $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(x)=1$, which completes the proof for $n=4$.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
Let $\mathcal{L}_{n,p}$ be a $\mathbb{Q}_p$-Lie algebra, where $n\geq 4$, and let $\varphi\in G_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ be an $\mathcal{L}_{n,p}$-automorphism, then
$\varphi_{11}(e_{12})=\lambda_1 e_{12}$ and $\varphi_{11}(e_{n,n-1})=\lambda_{n-1}e_{n-1,n}$, or $\varphi_{11}(e_{12})=\lambda_{n-1} e_{n-1,n}$ and $\varphi_{11}(e_{n,n-1})=\lambda_1 e_{1,2}$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
We look at the centralizer of $e_{12}$ in the quotient $\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}$, namely $\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}}(e_{12})$. Clearly, for any $e_{i,i+2}\in\sfrac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_3}$, we have that $[e_{12},e_{i,i+2}]$ is either zero, or $i=2$ and then $[e_{12},e_{24}]=e_{14}\in\gamma_3\mathcal{L}_{n,p}$, which vanishes in the quotient $\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_3}$, which means that in either case it is zero in this quotient. Therefore, we look only at elements $e_{i,i+1}\in\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}$. It is readily seen that every element of the form $e_{i,i+1}$ where $i\neq 2$ commutes with $e_{12}$, hence $\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(e_{12})=\langle e_{12},e_{34},e_{45},\dots,e_{n-2,n-1},e_{n-1,n}\rangle$, so $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(e_{12})=\dim\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}-1$, but since $\varphi_{11}$ is an automorphism, it must preserve the dimension of the centralizer, meaning $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(\varphi_{11}(e_{12}))=\dim\mathcal{C}_{\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}(e_{12})=\dim\sfrac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}-1$. But by corollary \ref{prop.n.geq.4.centralizer.codimension}, if $n\geq 5$, then $\varphi_{11}(e_{12})=\lambda e_{12}$ or $\varphi_{11}(e_{12})=\lambda e_{n-1,n}$, and it is readily seen that the same applies also for $\varphi_{11}(e_{n-1,n})$, and since $\varphi$ is injective, then clearly, if $\varphi_{11}(e_{12})=\lambda e_{12}$ then $\varphi_{11}(e_{n-1,n})=\lambda e_{n-1,n}$, and if $\varphi_{11}(e_{12})=\lambda e_{n-1,n}$ then $\varphi_{11}(e_{n-1,n})=\lambda e_{12}$. If $n=4$, then by the same corollary, $\varphi_{11}(e_{12})=\lambda e_{12}+\mu e_{34}$, where $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are not both zero, which means that the same proof does not hold. Therefore, we now look at the centralizer of $e_{12}$ in the algebra $\mathcal{L}_{4,p}$ itself. We denote by $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{L}_{4,p}}(e_{12})$ the centralizer of $e_{12}$ in the algebra, which is $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{L}_{4,p}}(e_{12})=\langle e_{12},e_{34},e_{13},e_{14}\rangle$, so $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{L}_{4,p}}(e_{12})=4$. Denote by $x=\varphi(e_{12})=\lambda_{12}e_{12}+\lambda_{23}e_{23}+\lambda_{34}e_{34}+\lambda_{13}e_{13}+\lambda_{24}e_{24}+\lambda_{14}e_{14}\in\mathcal{L}_{4,p}$, and denote by $y=\mu_{12}e_{12}+\mu_{23}e_{23}+\mu_{34}e_{34}+\mu_{13}e_{13}+\mu_{24}e_{24}+\mu_{14}e_{14}\in\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{L}_{4,p}}(e_{12})$, an element in the centralizer of $e_{12}$, hence $[x,y]=(\lambda_{12}\mu_{23}-\lambda_{23}\mu_{12})e_{13}+(\lambda_{23}\mu_{34}-\lambda_{34}\mu_{23})e_{24}+(\lambda_{12}\mu_{24}-\lambda_{24}\mu_{12}+\lambda_{13}\mu_{34}-\lambda_{34}\mu_{13})e_{14}=0$. Assume all the coefficients of the linear combination that forms $x$ are non-zero. Then, as seen earlier, we have that $\mu_{23}=\frac{\lambda_{23}}{\lambda_{12}}\mu_{12}$, and $\mu_{34}=\frac{\lambda_{34}}{\lambda_{23}}\mu_{23}=\frac{\lambda_{34}}{\lambda_{23}}\frac{\lambda_{23}}{\lambda_{12}}\mu_{12}=\frac{\lambda_{34}}{\lambda_{12}}\mu_{12}$, and also $\lambda_{12}\mu_{24}-\lambda_{24}\mu_{12}+\lambda_{13}\mu_{34}-\lambda_{34}\mu_{13}=0$, which means that $\mu_{24}=\frac{\lambda_{24}\mu_{12}+\lambda_{13}\mu_{34}-\lambda_{34}\mu_{13}}{\lambda_{12}}=\frac{\lambda_{24}\mu_{12}+\lambda_{13}\frac{\lambda_{34}}{\lambda_{12}}\mu_{12}-\lambda_{34}\mu_{13}}{\lambda_{12}}$, hence we can choose freely $\mu_{12}$, $\mu_{13}$ and $\mu_{14}$, while $\mu_{23}$ and $\mu_{34}$ depend on $\mu_{12}$, and $\mu_{24}$ depends on $\mu_{12}$ and $\mu_{13}$, which means that $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{L}_{4,p}}(y)=3<4=\dim\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{L}_{4,p}}(e_{12})$. Assume that all the coefficients of $x$ are non-zero, except for $\lambda_{23}=0$, then $\lambda_{12}\mu_{23}$ and $\lambda_{34}\mu_{23}$ must vanish, hence $\mu_{23}=0$, but then $\mu_{34}$ does not depend on $\mu_{23}$, which implies that it does not depend on $\mu_{12}$ either, and can be chosen freely, hence there is no change in the dimension of $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{L}_{4,p}}(e_{12})$ from the general case. Now we assume $x=\lambda_{12}e_{12}+z$, where $z\in\gamma_2\mathcal{L}_{4,p}$, and observe the three equations from above with the current assumption. The second equation $\lambda_{23}\mu_{34}-\lambda_{34}\mu_{23}=0$ completely falls, which from the other two we obtain that $\lambda_{12}\mu_{23}$ and $\lambda_{12}\mu_{24}$ must vanish, which means that $\mu_{23}=\mu_{24}=0$, while $\mu_{12}$, $\mu_{34}$, $\mu_{13}$ and $\mu_{14}$ can be chosen freely, which means that $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{L}_{4,p}}(y)=4=\dim\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{L}_{4,p}}(e_{12})$. One checks that the same applies also for $\varphi(e_{12})=\lambda_{34}e_{34}+z$, and that no other linear combination of $x$ satisfies that $\dim\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{L}_{4,p}}(\varphi(e_{12}))=\dim\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{L}_{4,p}}(e_{12})$.
