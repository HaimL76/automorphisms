\begin{abstract}
Let $G$ be any group. For any natural number $n\in\mathbb{N}$, let $a_{n}(G)$ be the number of subgroups $H\leq G$, such that $[G:H]=n$. Assume $G$ is finitely-generated, then $a_{n}(G)<\infty$, and we can define a Dirichlet series of the form $\zeta_G(s):=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{n}(G){n}^{-s}$, where $s\in\mathbb{C}$. Assume, in addition, that $G$ is also nilpotent and torsion-free, then this function has some properties of the Riemann zeta-function $\zeta$, such as the Euler decomposition of $\zeta$ into a product of local factors indexed by primes. A version of this zeta-function counts pro-isomorphic subgroups, and an analogous function may be defined for appropriate Lie rings. We study here the pro-isomorphic zeta-functions for a family of nilpotent Lie rings of unbounded nilpotency class. We shall compute the automorphism groups of these Lie rings explicitly, prove uniformity of the local factors of the pro-isomorphic zeta-functions, and aim to determine them explicitly.
\end{abstract}
\section{Scientific Background}
\subsection{Introduction}
Although we will work with Lie algebras, for motivation we first present analogous and more natural questions in the context of groups.
\begin{proposition} \label{prop:finite.number.subgroups}
Let $G$ be any finitely generated group, and let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ be any natural number. Then there is a finite number of subgroups $H\leq G$, such that $[G:H]=n$
\end{proposition}
This proposition gives rise to an entire branch of group theory, called \textbf{subgroup growth}. We denote by $a_{n}(G)=a_{n}^{\leq}(G):=|\{H\leq{G} : [G:H]=n\}|$ the number of subgroups of $G$ of index $n$, and look at the sequence $\{a_n(G)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$. The subject of subgroup growth aims to relate the properties of this sequence to the algebraic structure of $G$. We denote by $a_{n}^{\trianglelefteq}(G):=|\{H\trianglelefteq{G} : [G:H]=n\}|$ the number of \textbf{normal} subgroups of $G$. We now define another type of subgroups of $G$.
\begin{definition}
\label{def:profinite.closure}
Let $G$ be any group, and let $\mathcal{N}(G):=\{N_k\trianglelefteq G\}_{k\in I}$ be the set of all normal subgroups of $G$. We define a partial order on $\mathcal{N}(G)$ by reverse inclusion, that is, for every two indices $i,j$ we say that $i\leq j$ if and only if $N_j\subseteq N_i$, hence for every $i\leq j$ there exists a natural projection map $\pi_{ji}:\sfrac{G}{N_
j}\rightarrow\sfrac{G}{N_i}$. The inverse limit \[\widehat{G}=\underset{\leftarrow}{lim}\{\sfrac{G}{N_k}\}_{k\in I}:=\{(h_k)_{k\in I}\in\prod_{k\in I}\sfrac{G}{N_k} : \pi_{ji}(h_j)=h_i,\forall i\leq j\}\] is called the \textbf{profinite closure} of $G$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
\label{def:pro.isomorphic}
Let $G$ be any group. A subgroup $H\leq G$ is called \textbf{pro-isomorphic} if $\widehat{H}\cong\widehat{G}$.
\end{definition}
We denote by $\hat{a_n}(G):=|\{H\leq G : \widehat{H}\cong\widehat{G}, [G:H]=n\}|$ the number of \textbf{pro-isomorphic} subgroups of $G$.
\begin{definition}
\label{def:zeta.function}
Let $G$ be a finitely-generated group, and let $\ast\in\{\leq,\trianglelefteq,\wedge\}$, then we define zeta-functions of the form $\zeta_{G}^{\ast}(s):=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}^{\ast}(G){n}^{-s}$. 
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}
Let $G$ be a $\mathcal{T}$-group, i.e. finitely-generated, nilpotent and torsion-free group, and let $\ast\in\{\leq,\trianglelefteq,\wedge\}$, then the zeta-functions for $G$ have the following attributes:\par
\textbf{Polynomial growth and convergence}. $a_{n}(G)\leq{C}n^{b}$, for some $b,C$ constant, thus, for all $\ast$, we get that $\zeta_{G}^{\ast}(s)$ converges on some right half-plane $\mathrm{Re}(s)>\alpha$, for $\alpha$ constant. The abscissa of convergence is $\alpha^{\ast}:=\inf\{\alpha : \zeta_{G}^{\ast}(s)<\infty,\mathrm{Re}(s)>\alpha\}$, and we have that $\alpha^{\ast}\in\mathbb{Q}$.\par
\textbf{Euler decomposition}.
For all $\ast$, we have that $\zeta_{G}^{\ast}(s)=\prod_{p}\zeta_{G,p}^{\ast}(s)$, where $\zeta_{G,p}^{\ast}(s)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{p^k}^{\ast}(G)p^{-ks}$.\par
\textbf{Rationality}. For all $\ast$, all $p$, there is a rational function $W_{p}^{\ast}\in\mathbb{Q}(X)$, such that $\zeta_{G,p}^{\ast}(s)=W_{p}^{\ast}(p^{-s})$.\par
\textbf{Functional equation}. Suppose we have \textbf{finite uniformity}, i.e. we have $r$ rational functions $W_{1}^{\ast}(X,Y),\dots,W_{r}^{\ast}(X,Y)\in\mathbb{Q}(X,Y)$, such that for all $p$, there is some $1\leq{i}\leq{r}$ such that $\zeta_{G,p}^{\ast}(s)=W_{i}^{\ast}(p,p^{-s})$. We say $W_{i}^{\ast}$ satisfies a \textbf{functional equation} if $W_{i}^{\ast}(X^{-1},Y^{-1})=X^{a}Y^{b}{W_{i}^{\ast}(X,Y)}$, where $a,b\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, $X^{a}Y^{b}$ being called the \textbf{symmetry factor}. Thus,
if $G$ is a $\mathcal{T}$-group, then $\zeta_{G,p}^{\leq}(s)$ satisfies a functional equation, for all but finitely many $p$, with the same symmetry factor. If $G$ is a $\mathcal{T}$-group of nilpotency class $2$, same is true for $\zeta_{G,p}^{\trianglelefteq}(s)$.
\end{proposition}
If any zeta-function, which is a special case of the Dirichlet series, has some properties of convergence on some subset of $\mathbb{C}$, one may reconstruct its coefficients $a_{n}^{\ast}(G)$, the number of subgroups of our interest, using the \textbf{Perron's formula}, which is an implementation of a \textbf{reverse Mellin transform}, as discussed, for example, in \cite{MontgomeryVaughan}, but this discussion is out of the scope of our research.\par
This research concentrates on the growth of \textbf{pro-isomorphic} subgroups defined above, hence we shall restrict our further discussion to the pro-isomorphic case only.
For example, we look at the additive group of integers $G=(\mathbb{Z},+)$, for which, every subgroup $H\leq{\mathbb{Z}}$ is of the form $H=n\mathbb{Z}=\langle n\rangle$, for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$, which means that $H\cong \mathbb{Z}$, as both are infinite cyclic groups, and so, $\widehat{H}\cong\widehat{\mathbb{Z}}$. Since we have only one subgroup of index $n$, for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, then $a_n(\mathbb{Z})=\hat{a_n}(\mathbb{Z})=1$. Thus, its pro-isomorphic zeta-function is $\hat{\zeta_{\mathbb{Z}}}(s)=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}n^{-s}=\zeta(s)$, the Riemann zeta-function, which is known to converge for $\mathrm{Re}(s)>1$. We recall that the Riemann zeta-function decomposes into an infinite product of local zeta-functions, that is, $\zeta(s)=\prod_p\zeta_p(s)=\prod_p\sum_{k=0}^\infty p^{-ks}=\prod_p\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}$, where the product runs over all the prime numbers.
\subsection{Linearization}
We want to transfer the ideas from the above discussion about groups to a linear context, where we can use tools from linear algebra.
Hence, for finitely-generated torsion-free nilpotent groups $G$, we associate nilpotent Lie algebras over $\mathbb{Z}$. This, in general, is called the \textbf{Mal'cev correspondence}. 
If $L$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-Lie algebra, namely a free $\mathbb{Z}$-module of finite rank with a Lie bracket operation, then consider the number $\hat{a_n}(L)$ of subalgebras $M\leq L$, where $n=[L:M]$, such that $M\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}\mathbb{Z}_p\cong L\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}\mathbb{Z}_p$, where $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is the ring of $p$-adic integers, for all primes $p$, and it is also known that $\hat{a_n}(L)<\infty$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. The Dirichlet series $\hat{\zeta_L}(s):=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\hat{a_n}(L)n^{-s}$, is called the \textbf{pro-isomorphic zeta-function} of $L$. By the Mal'cev correspondence, to every finitely-generated, nilpotent, torsion-free group $G$, one may associate a Lie algebra $L=L(G)$, such that $\hat{\zeta_{G,p}}(s)=\hat{\zeta_{L,p}}(s)$, for all but finitely many primes $p$. If $G$ has nilpotency class $2$, one may obtain the equality for all primes. For this $L$, choose a basis $B=\{b_1,\dots,b_r\}$, where $r=\mathrm{rank}L$. Let $\mathcal{L}_{p}=L\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}\mathbb{Q}_p$, for any $p$. This is a $\mathbb{Q}_p$-Lie algebra, and our choice of basis allows us to identify the automorphism group $G(\mathbb{Q}_p)=Aut_{\mathbb{Q}_p}(\mathcal{L}_{p})$ with a subgroup of $GL_r(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. Note that $\mathcal{L}_{p}$ contains a $\mathbb{Z}_p$-lattice, $L_{p}=L\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}\mathbb{Z}_p$. If $\varphi\in G(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, then $\varphi(L_{p})=L_{p}$ if and only if $\varphi\in G(\mathbb{Z}_p)=G(\mathbb{Q}_p)\cap GL_r(\mathbb{Z}_p)$. Here $GL_r(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ is the group of $r\times r$ matrices which are invertible over $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Similarly, $\varphi(L_{p})\subseteq L_{p}$ if and only if $\varphi\in G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p):=G(\mathbb{Q}_p)\cap \mathcal{M}_r(\mathbb{Z}_p)$, where $\mathcal{M}_r(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ is the collection of $r\times r$ matrices with entries in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Note that $G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is a monoid, not a group.\par
Denote by $G(\mathbb{Z}_p)g$, where $g\in G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, a right-coset of $G(\mathbb{Z}_p)$. One checks that the monoid $G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is a disjoint union of right-cosets of $G(\mathbb{Z}_p)$.\par
The discussion above reveals the construction we base our research upon.
We observe that there is a bijection between the set $G(\mathbb{Z}_p)\backslash G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ of right-cosets of $G(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ and the set $\{M\leq L_{p} : M\cong L_{p}\}$ of $L_{p}$-subalgebras which are isomorphic to $L_{p}$ itself. This bijection takes $G(\mathbb{Z}_p)g$ to $M=\varphi(L_{p})$. For any $\varphi\in G(\mathbb{Z}_p)g$, this is well-defined. One checks that for every $\psi\in G(\mathbb{Z}_p)g$, we have that $\psi(L_{p})=\varphi(L_{p})=M$.
For each right-coset $G(\mathbb{Z}_p)g$, if $M=\varphi(L_{p})$, where $\varphi\in G(\mathbb{Z}_p)g$, then $[L_{p}:M]=|\det\varphi|_p^{-1}$, where $|\det\varphi|_p$ is the $p$-adic norm of $\det\varphi$, and therefore,\par $\hat{\zeta_{L,p}}(s)=\underset{\overset{\scriptscriptstyle M\leq L_{p}}{\scriptscriptstyle M\cong L_{p}}}{\sum}[L_{p}:M]^{-s}=\underset{\scriptscriptstyle G(\mathbb{Z}_p)\varphi\in G(\mathbb{Z}_p)\backslash G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)}{\sum}|\det\varphi|_p^s$.
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm.rational.function}
Let $\ast\in\{\leq,\trianglelefteq,\wedge\}$, then $\zeta_{L,p}^{\ast}(s)$ is rational, i.e. there is a rational function in one variable $W_p\in\mathbb{Q}(X)$ such that $\zeta_{L,p}^{\ast}(s)=W_p(p^{-s})$, for all $p$ prime.
\end{theorem}
After establishing rationality for the local zeta-functions in the Euler decomposition of $\zeta_{L,p}^{\ast}(s)$, one may study the uniformity or finite-uniformity of $\zeta_{L}^{\ast}(s)$ itself, where $\zeta_{L}^{\ast}$ is said to be \textbf{finitely-uniform} if the local zeta-functions in its Euler decomposition are represented by a finite set of $r$ rational functions, for all but finitely many $p$, and \textbf{uniform} if $r=1$.
The uniformity of the zeta-functions of some algebras is established in the work of Grunewald, Segal and Smith, see \cite{GrunewaldSegalSmith}. We aim to show that our target $\mathbb{Z}$-Lie algebra is uniform, or at least finitely-uniform.
\subsection{$p$-adic Integration}
\begin{definition}
\label{def.right.haar.measure}
Let $\Gamma$ be a locally compact topological group, i.e. for all $\gamma\in\Gamma$, there is an open neighborhood of $\gamma\in U_{\gamma}$ and a compact subset $K_{\gamma}$, such that $U_{\gamma}\subset K_{\gamma}$. Then there is a measure $\mu$, with the following property: for any measurable subset $U\subseteq\Gamma$ and any $\gamma\in\Gamma$, we have that $\mu(U\gamma)=\mu(U)$, where $U\gamma:=\{u\gamma : u\in U\}$. Such a measure $\mu$ is called a \textbf{right Haar measure}, and is unique up to multiplication by a non-zero constant.
\end{definition}
Following this definition of a right Haar measure, we claim that for every prime number $p$, the group $G(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is a locally compact topological group. We also claim that a right Haar measure $\mu$ on $G$ can be normalized such that $\mu(G(\mathbb{Z}_p))=1$, and the normalized measure of any right-coset of $G(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ equals to the measure of $G(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ itself, i.e. for every $g\in G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, we have that $\mu(G(\mathbb{Z}_p)g)=\mu(G(\mathbb{Z}_p))=1$.
Following this, we calculate the $p$-adic norm of the determinant of every $L_{p}$-automorphism, as a $p$-adic integral over our measure space.
Given any $L_{p}$-automorphism in some right-coset $\varphi\in G(\mathbb{Z}_p)\varphi$, we have that $|\det\varphi|_p^s=\displaystyle\int_{G(\mathbb{Z}_p)\varphi}|\det\varphi|_p^sd\mu$, because $\mu(G(\mathbb{Z}_p)\varphi)=1$, and $|\det\varphi|_p^{-1}$ is fixed on $G(\mathbb{Z}_p)\varphi$.\par
To calculate our target function, we observe that\par $\hat{\zeta_{L,p}}(s)=\underset{\scriptscriptstyle G(\mathbb{Z}_p)\varphi\in G(\mathbb{Z}_p)\backslash G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)}{\sum}|\det\varphi|_p^s=\underset{\scriptscriptstyle G(\mathbb{Z}_p)\varphi\in G(\mathbb{Z}_p)\backslash G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)}{\sum}\displaystyle\int_{G(\mathbb{Z}_p)\varphi}|\det\varphi|_p^sd\mu=\displaystyle\int_{G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)}|\det\varphi|_p^sd\mu$.\par 
This calculation of the local $\zeta_p$-function as a $p$-adic integral was established by the work of du Sautoy and Lubotzky, in \cite{DuSautoyLubotzky}, and we aim to study this integral and its attributes, where the integrand and domain of integration come from our target $\mathbb{Z}_p$-Lie algebra.
\section{Research Goals and Methodology}
\subsection{The Lie algebras $L_{n,p}$}
Let $e_{ij}$ be an $n\times{n}$ matrix, in which all the elements are zero, except for the element in row $i$ and column $j$ which has $1$. On the set $E=\{e_{i,i+1} : 1\leq{i}\leq{n-1}\}$ we define a bracket operation: for every $1\leq{k,l}\leq{n-1}$, define $[e_{k,k+1},e_{l,l+1}]:=e_{k,k+1}e_{l,l+1}-e_{l,l+1}e_{k,k+1}$. One checks that applying this bracket operation on $E$ repeatedly, generates $B=\{e_{ij} : 1\leq{i}<{j}\leq{n}\}$. Let $\mathcal{R}$ be some commutative ring, then the standard operation of $\mathcal{R}$ on $B$ through scalar multiplication, along with the defined bracket operation, form a nilpotent $\mathcal{R}$-Lie algebra. Considering $\mathcal{R}=\mathbb{Z}$, we obtain a nilpotent $\mathbb{Z}$-Lie algebra of strictly upper triangular matrices over $\mathbb{Z}$, which we denote by $L_{n}$, with the bracket operation defined above as its Lie bracket. As discussed above, this $\mathbb{Z}$-Lie algebra can be extended to a $\mathbb{Z}_p$-algebra, which we denote by $L_{n,p}$, and then to a $\mathbb{Q}_p$-algebra, which we denote by $\mathcal{L}_{n,p}$. In all the following, when $n$ and $p$ are clear from the context, we may denote $L$ instead of $L_{n,p}$ and $\mathcal{L}$ instead of $\mathcal{L}_{n,p}$, for abbreviation.
One checks that the set of matrices $B$ spans the whole $\mathbb{Z}$-Lie algebra $L$ and is $\mathbb{Z}$-linearly independent, hence it forms a basis for $L$ as a free module over $\mathbb{Z}$, which we call the \textbf{standard basis} of $L$. One also checks easily that $|B|=\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}k=\binom{n}{2}$, for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$. We apply a linear order to $B$, by defining $e_{ij}<e_{kl}$ if $j-i<l-k$ or if $j-i=l-k$ and $i<k$. In other words, the order we apply divides $E$ to elements of the quotients $\sfrac{L}{\gamma_2{L}},\sfrac{\gamma_2{L}}{\gamma_3{L}},\dots,\sfrac{\gamma_{n-2}{L}}{\gamma_{n-1}{L}},\gamma_{n-1}{L}$. The same goes also for the extensions of $L$, namely $L_{n,p}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{n,p}$. The target of our research is studying the zeta-function $\hat{\zeta_{L,p}}$ on some family of these $\mathbb{Z}_p$-Lie algebras, and the related constructions.
\begin{remark}
Let $\mathcal{R}$ be a commutative ring, and let $\mathcal{U}_n(\mathcal{R})$ be the group of $n\times{n}$ upper unitriangular matrices over $\mathcal{R}$, with the standard matrix multiplication as the group operation. Denote by $\mathcal{U}_{n,p}=\mathcal{U}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ the unitriangular matrix group over $\mathbb{Z}_p$, then by Mal'cev correspondence, $\hat{\zeta_{\mathcal{U}_{n,p}}}(s)=\hat{\zeta_{L_{n,p}}}(s)$, for all but finitely many primes $p$. This relates the subject of research to the motivation presented at the beginning of this paper.
\end{remark}
\subsection{Research goals}
The project consists of three major steps:\par
1. \textbf{Computing the automorphism group of the $\mathbb{Q}_p$-Lie algebras $\mathcal{L}_{n,p}$, for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and all primes $p$.}\par
2. \textbf{Showing that the pro-isomorphic zeta-functions $\hat{\zeta_{L_{n,p}}}(s)$ are uniform for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.}\par
3. \textbf{Giving an explicit uniform formula for the zeta-functions $\hat{\zeta_{L_{n,p}}}(s)$ for specific values of $n$, if not for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.}
Specifically for $n=5$ we aim to continue the work of Mark N. Berman, who proved that $\hat{\zeta_{L_{5,p}}}(s)$ is uniform.\par
As we elaborate further, steps 1 and 2 are already known entirely for $n\in\{4,5\}$, while for $n=4$ step 3 is also known.
We start with the first step of calculating $Aut_{\mathbb{Q}_p}(\mathcal{L}_{n,p})$. These automorphism groups have been studied before from a different point of view, and there are classical results showing that any automorphism may be expressed as a product of automorphisms of a specific type; see, for instance, the main result of Gibbs \cite{Gibbs}.  These results are not explicit enough for our purposes; indeed, the submonoid $G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ arises for us as the domain of integration of a $p$-adic integral.  In order to calculate this integral, we need to decompose the automorphism group $G(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ into a repeated semi-direct product of groups with a simple structure.
\par
After we have analyzed the structure of $G(\mathbb{Z}_p)$, we will need to construct the monoid $G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ and its $G(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ right-cosets, as we have seen above. This will give us both the function to integrate, which is $\det\varphi$ for every $G(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ right-coset $G(\mathbb{Z}_p)\varphi$, and the domain of integration, which is the monoid $G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. We will use this information to analyze the behavior of the $p$-adic integral we have described above and prove that its calculation depends only on $p$, thus showing that the $\hat{\zeta_{L,p}}$-function is uniform.
\subsection{$L_{n,p}$-Lie algebras for $n\geq{5}$}
Mark N. Berman, in his doctoral thesis \cite{Berman}, has displayed an explicit formula for $\hat{\zeta_{L_{4,p}}}$, and proved that $\hat{\zeta_{L_{5,p}}}$ is indeed uniform. We aim to generalize his work to prove that $\hat{\zeta_{L_{n,p}}}$ is uniform for all $n$. We also aim to compute $\hat{\zeta_{\mathcal{L}_{n,p}}}(s)$ explicitly for all $n$, or at least to obtain explicit formulas for some $n\geq 5$, and specifically for $n=5$. By analyzing carefully Berman's work on $L_{4,p}$ and $L_{5,p}$, we gain the basic understanding of the expected structure of the local zeta-functions in the general case.
We begin our discussion of the first goal, which is computing $G(\mathbb{Z}_p)$, by first recalling that for every $v\in L_{n,p}$, where $n\geq3$, we present $\varphi(v)$ as the multiplication of $v$ by a matrix from the right $\varphi(v)=vM$. As stated earlier, $M$ is an $r\times r$ matrix, where $r=\mathrm{rank}L_{n,p}$, whose lines are set by the order we have defined above, i.e. considering the standard ordered basis \[B=\{e_{
12},e_{23},\dots,e_{n-1,n},e_{13},\dots,e_{n-2,n},\dots,e_{1n}\}\] then $M$ is the following matrix,
$$
M=\begin{pmatrix}
\varphi(e_{12})\\
\varphi(e_{23})\\
\varphi(e_{n-1,n})\\
\hdashline
\varphi(e_{13})\\
\vdots\\
\varphi(e_{n-2,n})\\
\hdashline
\vdots\\
\hdashline
\varphi(e_{1n})\\
\end{pmatrix}\\
$$
Given an $\mathcal{L}$-automorphism $\varphi$, we denote by $\varphi_k:\gamma_k\mathcal{L}\rightarrow\gamma_k\mathcal{L}$ the operation of $\varphi$ on all the $n-k$ elements of the lower central series starting from $k$, that is, we consider only the images \[\varphi(e_{1,1+k}),\varphi(e_{2,2+k}),\dots,\varphi(e_{n-k,n}),\varphi(e_{1,2+k}),\dots,\varphi(e_{n-k-1,n}),\dots,\varphi(e_{1n})\]
For every $\varphi_k$, we have the induced map denoted by $\varphi_{kk}$, from the quotient algebra $\sfrac{\gamma_k}{\gamma_{k+1}}$ to itself, defined by $\varphi_{kk}(e_{l,l+k}+\gamma_{k+1}\mathcal{L}):=a_{1,1+k}e_{1,1+k}+a_{2,2+k}e_{2,2+k}+\cdots+a_{n-k,n}e_{n-k,n}+z_{k+1}$, where $z_{k+1}\in\gamma_{k+1}\mathcal{L}$, for every $1\leq{l}\leq{n-k}$. Clearly, $\varphi_{kk}$ is well-defined, since $\varphi_k(\gamma_k\mathcal{L})=\gamma_k\mathcal{L}$, for every $1\leq{k}\leq{n-1}$.
Following this division of $\mathcal{L}$ by the lower central series and its quotients, we view $M$ as a block matrix, \[M=\begin{pmatrix}
M_{11} & \vline & M_{12}&\vline & \dots& \vline & M_{1,n-2} & \vline&M_{1,n-1}\\
\hline
M_{21} & \vline & M_{22}&\vline & \dots &\vline & M_{2,n-2} &\vline& M_{2,n-1}\\
\hline
\vdots & \vline & \vdots&\vline & \ddots &\vline & \vdots &\vline& \vdots\\
\hline
M_{n-1,1} & \vline & M_{n-1,2}&\vline & \dots &\vline & M_{n-1,n-2} &\vline& M_{n-1,n-1}\\
\end{pmatrix}\]
each block is denoted by $M_{kl}\in\mathcal{M}_{m\times{r}}(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, where $m=\dim\sfrac{\gamma_k}{\gamma_{k+1}}$ and $r=\dim\sfrac{\gamma_l}{\gamma_{l+1}}$. From this, we can understand that the blocks on the main diagonal of $M$, which are the induced quotient maps defined above, are square matrices $\varphi_{kk}=M_{kk}\in\mathcal{M}_{n-k}(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. A trivial observation is that since all the elements of the lower central series of $\mathcal{L}$ are characteristic subalgebras, then $\sfrac{\varphi(\gamma_k\mathcal{L})}{\gamma_k\mathcal{L}}=0$, which means that all the matrix blocks $M_{kl}$, where $k<l$, must be zero, therefore $M$ has the form, \[M=\begin{pmatrix}
M_{11} & \vline & M_{12}&\vline & M_{13} & \dots& \vline & M_{1,n-2} & \vline&M_{1,n-1}\\
\hline
0 & \vline & M_{22}&\vline & M_{23} & \dots &\vline & M_{2,n-2} &\vline& M_{2,n-1}\\
\hline
\vdots & \vline & \vdots&\vline & \vdots & \ddots &\vline & \vdots &\vline& \vdots\\
\hline
0 & \vline & 0&\vline & 0 & \dots &\vline & M_{2,n-2} &\vline& M_{2,n-1}\\
\hline
0 & \vline & 0 &\vline & 0 & \dots &\vline & 0 &\vline& M_{n-1,n-1}\\
\end{pmatrix}
\]
\subsection{Preliminary results}
\label{preliminary.results}
We have made progress towards step 1 of our research program, namely determining the automorphism groups $G(\mathbb{Q}_p)$.
The first result in this direction appears already in the thesis of M. N. Berman\cite[Prop. 3.6]{Berman}.
\begin{proposition}
Let $\varphi\in{G(\mathbb{Q}_p)}$ be a $\mathcal{L}$-automorphism, and $M$ its representing matrix, divided into matrix blocks, as shown earlier. Then, $M_{11}\in\mathcal{M}_{n-1}(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is either diagonal or anti-diagonal.
\end{proposition}
Define an involution $\eta\in{G(\mathbb{Q}_p)}$ by $\eta(e_{ij}):=(-1)^{j-i-1}e_{n+1-j,n+1-i}$, for $1\leq{i}\leq{n-1}$ and ${i+1}\leq{j}\leq{n}$. Replacing $\varphi$ by $\varphi\circ\eta$, we assume without loss of generality that $M_{11}$ is diagonal.
We check, for any $\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},\dots,\lambda_{n-1}\in\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{\ast}$, that the diagonal matrix \[h=\mathrm{diag}(\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},\dots,\lambda_{n-1},\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2},\lambda_{2}\lambda_{3}\dots,\lambda_{n-2}\lambda_{n-1},\dots,\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}\cdots\lambda_{n-2}\lambda_{n-1})\]
represents an automorphism of $\mathcal{L}$. Thus, multiplying $\varphi$ from the right by a unique such automorphism, we may now assume that $M$ has $1$'s on the diagonal. By this print we know
$H(\mathbb{Q}_{p}):=\{\mathrm{diag}(\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},\dots) : \lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},\dots\in\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{\ast}\}$ is the \textbf{reductive part} of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$, while $N(\mathbb{Q}_{p}):=\{\varphi\in{G(\mathbb{Q}_{p})}$ with $1$'s
 in diagonal $\}$ is the \textbf{unipotent radical} of $G(\mathbb{Q}_{p})$.
Every $g\in{G(\mathbb{Q}_{p})}$ has a unique decomposition $g=\mathfrak{n}\mathfrak{h}$, with $\mathfrak{n}\in{N}(\mathbb{Q}_{p})$, $\mathfrak{h}\in{H(\mathbb{Q}_{p})}$. We aim to determine the structure of the unipotent radical $N(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ by decomposing it into a semidirect product of abelian subgroups. 
We can simplify the domain of integration, for the $p$-adic integral that we aim to calculate, at the price of replacing a single integral by multiple integrals. As we saw earlier, the calculation of $\hat{\zeta_{L}}(s)$ requires computing $G(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ and $G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ first. Assuming we have already computed $G(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, based on the strategy that we have presented above, we need to identify $G(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ as a subgroup of $G(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, which is expected not to be difficult, and continue from there to identify the monoid $G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, which is expected to be a substantial challenge. By applying \textbf{Fubini's theorem} for semidirect products of topological groups, we have that \[\hat\zeta_{\mathcal{L}}(s)=\displaystyle\int_{G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)}|\det\varphi|_p^sd\mu_{G(\mathbb{Z}_p)\varphi}=\displaystyle\int_{H^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)}\left(\displaystyle\int_{N_{\mathfrak{h}}^+}|\det\mathfrak{n}\mathfrak{h}|_p^sd\mu_{N(\mathbb{Q}_p)}\right)d\mu_{H(\mathbb{Q}_p)}\]
where $H^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ consists of all $\mathfrak{h}\in H(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ that appear in the decomposition $\varphi=\mathfrak{n}\mathfrak{h}$ for some $\varphi\in G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, and, for a given $\mathfrak{h}\in H^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, we set $N_\mathfrak{h}^+(\mathbb{Q}_p):=\{\mathfrak{n}\in N(\mathbb{Q}_p) : \mathfrak{n}\mathfrak{h}\in{G}^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)\}$. The integrand of the inner integral is constant, so the integral amounts to computing the measure of the set $N_{h}^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. The advantage that we gain by this decomposition is that it simplifies the calculation of the integral. The integral function $|\det{\mathfrak{n}\mathfrak{h}}|_p^s=|\det{\mathfrak{h}}|_p^s$ depends only on $\mathfrak{h}$, so computing the inner integral amounts to finding the measure of $N_{\mathfrak{h}}^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. For the unipotent matrix $\mathfrak{n}$, the determinant is $1$, for the digonal matrix $\mathfrak{h}$, we have the following proposition,
\begin{proposition}
\label{prop.h.matrix.determinant}
Let $n\geq{2}$, and let \[h=\mathrm{diag}(\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},\dots,\lambda_{n-1},\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2},\lambda_{2}\lambda_{3}\dots,\lambda_{n-2}\lambda_{n-1},\dots,\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}\cdots\lambda_{n-2}\lambda_{n-1})\]
as defined above, then $\det{\mathfrak{h}}=\prod_{i=1}^{n-1}\lambda_i^{i(n-i)}$.
\end{proposition}
We show this by induction on $n$.
We conclude this section with the observation that the sets $N_{h}^+(\mathbf{{Q}_p)}$ arising in our computation are quite complicated. We will decompose $N(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ into an iterated semidirect product of a large number of subgroups, each abelian with a simple structure. This will decompose the integral over $N_{h}^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ into a multiple integral that can be computed explicitly, given a suitable combinatorical framework. Hence, we strive to decompose $N_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ itself into a product of finitely many simpler subgroups, $N_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)= N_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)_1\rtimes_{\phi} N_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)_2\rtimes_{\phi}\cdots\rtimes_{\phi} N_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)_{m_n}$, where $m_n$ is the number of subgroups in the decomposition of $N_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, which means that $\displaystyle\int_{G^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)}|\det\varphi|_p^sd\mu_{G(\mathbb{Q}_p)}=\displaystyle\int_{H_n^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)}\left(\displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{N}^+_{m_n}}\cdots\left(\displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{N}^+_3}\left(\displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{N}^+_2}\left(\displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{N}^+_1}|\det\varphi|_p^sd\mu_{\mathcal{N}_1}\right)d\mu_{\mathcal{N}_2}\right)d\mu_{\mathcal{N}_3}\right)\cdots d\mu_{\mathcal{N}_{m_n}}\right)d\mu_{H_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)}$, where we denote $\mathcal{N}_i:=N_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)_i$ and $\mathcal{N}^+_i:=N_n^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)_i$, for every $1\leq i\leq m_n$. One checks that every $\mathcal{N}^+_i$ depends on ${h},{n}_1,{n}_2,\dots,{n}_{i-1}$, if $\varphi={n}_{m_n}\cdots{n}_2{n}_1{h}$, where ${h}\in H_n^+(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ and ${n}_k\in\mathcal{N}_{k}$, for every $1\leq k\leq i-1$. 
All the subgroups in the decomposition of $N_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ are obviously unipotent as well, which means that their determinants are also $1$. This means that computing the inner integrals amounts to determining the measure of the sets $\mathcal{N}^+_i$ in terms of ${h},{n}_1,{n}_2,\dots,{n}_{n-1}$.







\subsection{Base Extension}
Let $K$ be a number field of degree $d=[K:\mathbb{Q}]$, and let $\mathcal{O}_K$ be its ring of integers. Let $L$ be a $\mathbb{Z}$-Lie algebra of rank $r$. By base extension we can consider $L\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}\mathcal{O}_K$ as a $\mathbb{Z}$-Lie algebra of rank $rd$, and by extension of scalars we can consider also $L_{K,p}=(L\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}\mathcal{O}_K)\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}\mathbb{Q}_p$ as a $\mathbb{Q}_p$-Lie algebra of the same rank. Berman-Glazer-Schein give a criterion in \cite{BermanGlazerSchein}, under which the pro-isomorphic zeta-function of $L_{K,p}$ can be calculated without a significant extra effort relative to that of $L_p$ itself. Note that the criterion does not necessarily apply for all $p$. We shall research whether the criterion applies to the $\mathbb{Q}_p$-Lie algebras $\mathcal{L}$ of our work. If so, then $\hat\zeta_{\mathcal{L}\otimes\mathcal{O}_K,p}$ will be finitely-uniform. In other words, for each of the finitely many decomposition types of a prime in $\mathcal{O}_K$, there is a rational function in two variables $W\in\mathbb{Q}(X,Y)$ such that $\hat\zeta_{\mathcal{L}\otimes\mathcal{O}_K,p}(s)=W(p,p^{-s})$ for all $p$ of that decomposition type.
